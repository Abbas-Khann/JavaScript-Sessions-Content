# JS Notes

Hello Learners, this is a repository for all the Javascript Notes that we took while going through 30 Days of Javascript challenge. We will be adding new notes for every session. Make sure to star this repository!

We will go through the Javascript Basics from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics). There will be a lot of projects for hands-on experience. 

It will be better if you join us in the sessions. And even if you are not able to, we are there to help you with the of this notes and also available in the [LearWeb3DAO](https://www.learnweb3.io/) discord server to talk directly!
